# Dark Enforcer
Is dark mode not implemented for apps on your Android device? With this module you can force it to be implemented!

This module is compatible with Magisk/KSU/KSU Next/APatch.

The module works according to the theme status of the device. If the device is in dark mode, it forces the applications to dark mode, if it is in light mode, it does not. In short, it works automatically.

This module is by [YZBruh](https://t.me/YZBruh) (me) and [𝙊𝙇𝙄𝟴𝟴](https://t.me/oliplusmzr). The actual coercive property value found in the module was reported by [𝙊𝙇𝙄𝟴𝟴](https://t.me/oliplusmzr). Thanks [𝙊𝙇𝙄𝟴𝟴](https://t.me/oliplusmzr)!
